# ML-Agents: Penguins - release 1 compatible

Like lot's of Unity Learn readers, we were trying [this tutorial]((https://learn.unity.com/project/ml-agents-penguins)) using the latest ML Agents, release 1, and it's changed too much.
In order to help, I've created this public repository which is an ML-Agents Release 1 (April 30, 2020) compatible upgrade of the Unity Learn [ML-Agents Penguins Tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/ml-agents-penguins).

This work is an help to upgrade the `ML-Agents: Penguins` tutorials to [ML-Agents Release 1](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_1).
